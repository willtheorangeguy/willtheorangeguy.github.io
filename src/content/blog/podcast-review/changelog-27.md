[The state of homelab tech (2024) with Techno Tim (Changelog & Friends #27)](https://changelog.com/friends/27)

-   I love these homelab episodes so much - the two of them talking with so much passion for their own homelabs and the open source or even closed source projects behind them really makes me excited about it.
-   Every single time I listen to one of these episodes or see something about it on YouTube I always have to remind myself to get my own work done before getting to play.
-   Unfortunately, the current apartment does not have the provisions for my own setup, but as soon as I move this will be priority.
-   Tried to set up Tailscale but that might be a project for another day...
-   Also, don't forget to visit the Techno Tim [YouTube channel](https://technotim.live/) - so great to watch
