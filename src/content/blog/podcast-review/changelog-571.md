[State of the "log" 2023 (Changelog Interviews #571) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/571)

-   This was a fun one to listen to, now I have even more other episodes to go download.
-   There was also a lot of episodes that I had actually listened too, which was cool since I consider myself a regular listener going into 2024.
-   ...kind of regret not calling in for this episode, but I do not know if I have reached that point in my "career" yet.
