[How long until we run out of fresh data to train the latest AI? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/01/05/gen-ai-data-synthetic-trends-crypto-vr-quantum-computing/)

-   The premise behind this topic makes complete sense to me, since more and more content is being generated by AI, so eventually AI will either need to become properly intelligent, or it will just keep reiterating data from itself.
-   I think that their takes for 2023 were good.
-   Only take I would take issue with (see what I did there) is the one on VR - maybe it is just because I have been more in touch with the gaming market this year, but I think that VR has actually gotten better and ~~Facebook~~ Meta has been doing a good job at pushing the industry forward.
-   Plus, as much as I am loathe to bring up Apple, they did release the Vision Pro this year, and once Apple does something, you know everyone else is going to have to start doing it too.
