[Bourbon and better software with Robert Ross, Founder and CEO of FireHydrant (Changelog & Friends #34)](https://changelog.com/friends/34)

- This was a great episode, even though liquor tasting advice has nothing to do with software, it was fun to learn, will have to apply this new knowledge next time I go whisky or scotch tasting.
- Cool to hear about the large corporations taking advantage of this software.
