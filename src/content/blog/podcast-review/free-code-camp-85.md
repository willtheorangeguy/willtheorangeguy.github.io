[freeCodeCamp Podcast: #85 10 Years of The Changelog + 5 years of freeCodeCamp (libsyn.com)](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/crossover-special-10-years-of-the-changelog-5-years-of-freecodecamp)

- This was a super looooooong episode.
- Fun to listen to the coming up stories of both podcasts, as someone who became a "regular" listener later on, it was cool to go back to the beginning and learn more about the start.
- Very much wish that tech was still a blossoming community like this, and it was this easy to break into the space.
