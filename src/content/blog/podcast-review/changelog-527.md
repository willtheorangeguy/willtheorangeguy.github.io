[What it takes to scale engineering with Rachel Potvin, former VP of Engineering at GitHub (Changelog Interviews #527) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/527)

- Pretty much it is just very important to make sure an engineering team stays small.
- ~100 person rule.
- As a team gets larger, spend more time focusing on documentation and recording why decisions were made.
- In large tech companies, the churn of people coming and going means that the original author of the code might not always be there.
- A Design Decision Document is a useful tool to record everyone's thoughts before an official decision is made, and then it can act as a record for afterwards as well.
