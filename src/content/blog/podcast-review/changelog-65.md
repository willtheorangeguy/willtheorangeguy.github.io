[The indispensable cog with Johnny Boursiquot (Changelog & Friends #65)](https://changelog.com/friends/65)

-   Another great Changelog & Friends episode.
-   I enjoyed hearing about the job search, and tips for what to do if you don't make the first cut. True stories from industry professionals are always great to hear.
-   The `.io` domain is a new news (haha) item, but I think the worry of it disappearing is over played. It will not disappear, especially with large companies (like `github.io`)  backing it.
