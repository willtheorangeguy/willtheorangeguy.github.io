[Reverse rug pull, so cool? (Changelog & Friends #61)](https://changelog.com/friends/61)

- This one was fun!
- I really appreciated the last chapter where they discussed the processes behind how the develop the podcasts, using manual file system version control through the three file process made a lot of sense.
- I also enjoyed the conversation on self hosting, and if I had a Wi-Fi router that I had complete control over, I would definitely be hopping on that bandwagon.
- Will be adding this episode to the "will recommend to others" list.
