[What exactly is Open Source AI? with Stefano Maffulli, Executive Director of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) (Changelog Interviews #578)](https://changelog.com/podcast/578)

-   I don't know what side of the "whether the OSI should exist or not" debate I am on. This episode is definetly food for thought however.
-   Nice to see that they are actually keeping up with the times, and changing their definition to match the current thoughts on AI.
