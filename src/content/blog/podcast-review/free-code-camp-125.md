[freeCodeCamp Podcast: #125 Open Source is Changing. The Changelog Host Jerod Santo Shows You How to Keep Up (libsyn.com)](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/125-open-source-is-changing-the-changelog-host-jerod-santo-shows-you-how-to-keep-up)

- Also another loooooong one...
- I listened to this back to back with the previous The Changelog X freeCodeCamp.([freeCodeCamp Podcast: #85 10 Years of The Changelog + 5 years of freeCodeCamp (libsyn.com)](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/crossover-special-10-years-of-the-changelog-5-years-of-freecodecamp)), and that may have been too much of them talking for me.
- Still a really interesting episode, loved to hear more about the start of The Changelog.
- Nice summation of the recent changes in the open source community.
