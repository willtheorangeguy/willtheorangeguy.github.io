[Scoring your project’s security with Chris Swan (Ship It! #94)](https://changelog.com/shipit/94)

- The scorecards are a super cool idea, I want to go through and add them to all my projects now.
- I feel like so many READMEs get a badge creep however - all of mine just keep getting more and more stuff added to them. Plus, as a perfectionist, I feel like I have to go back and add it to all the previous ones as well.
- Was a really good conversation in general.
