[What's next in JavaScript (a TC39 update) featuring Daniel Ehrenberg from Bloomberg (JS Party #305) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/305)

-   While being a JavaScript beginner, most of this knowledge was over my head, it was cool to hear some of the things.
-   Hopefully I can revisit this episode in the future when I understand more of the meaning behind the words and topics discussed.
