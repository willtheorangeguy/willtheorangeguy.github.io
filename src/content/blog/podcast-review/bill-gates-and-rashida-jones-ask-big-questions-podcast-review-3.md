# Why do we believe lies? - Bill Gates and Rashida Jones Ask Big Questions

- I see this even in the lives of my own friends, especially recently - it is so easy to get wrapped up in something, especially when we are bombarded by it on all sides by social media and the people that we think are our "friends" online.
- The point that was mentioned about feeling connected makes sense, since we are all striving for a type of connection, and if we can find them by going down a rabbit hole, we are so much more likely to do so.
- Yuval Harari's books are great and I am looking forward to reading them, I just really need to find the time to do so.
- I like the way that Yuval talked about the differences between lies and fiction, and how we are likely to tell fiction just because we wrap ourselves up in it and also want to believe it - as I reflect, I know that even I do that some time.
