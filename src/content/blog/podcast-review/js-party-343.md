[Digging through Jerod Santo’s tool box (JS Party #343)](https://changelog.com/jsparty/343)

-   I love these types of episodes. It is cool to see inside how the podcast is produced, and how each person develops in their time, with their personal toolset.
-   I wish there was more of this "series" and much more frequently as well.
-   I did not find anything super useful in theis episode, but still a great one to listen to.
