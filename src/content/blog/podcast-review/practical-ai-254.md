[Large Action Models (LAMs) & Rabbits üêá (Practical AI #254) (changelog.com)](https://changelog.com/practicalai/254)

- Cool to hear a take on the Rabbit R1.
- I have supplemented these reviews with those from numerous YouTubers.
- Regardless, I do not think I will be purchasing the Rabbit R1 - it really does not make sense to me.
- _Editor's Note: I listened to this episode very close to its release date, and since then I have not heard a single thing about the Rabbit R1, and you can see how long it has been. Probably safe to say that product has flopped, much like the Vision Pro._
