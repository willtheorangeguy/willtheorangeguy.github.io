[You'll rent chips and be happy with Zac Smith (Changelog & Friends #66)](https://changelog.com/friends/66)

-   As someone who listens to another podcast on tech news, it is nice to hear the cross section of the tech and dev cultures.
-   Unfortunately, renting houses/products/video games/software looks like the way we will be doing things going forward. As much as Software as a Service seems to be the way it is now, I am really quite over it. Good thing I will have access to my uni email for as long as possible to claim those student discounts.
