[You have how many open tabs?! featuring the hallway track at THAT Conference (Changelog &amp; Friends #29)](https://changelog.com/friends/29)

-   This was so much fun!
-   Nice to hear another bit from a hallway track.
-   The number of tabs is always a funny topic - I really think the use of bookmarks would be beneficial ðŸ˜‚
