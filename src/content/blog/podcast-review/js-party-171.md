[Less JavaScript more htmx with Carson from Big Sky Software (JS Party #171) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/171)

-   While this is an older episode, it is a goodie and I enjoyed hearing more about htmx.
-   I really liked how they were ok with creating projects that they knew would not get a lot of adoption, this is something that I need to add in to my own life and be ok with.
-   Since a project is not getting a lot of adoption, it should be fun for me and make me happy while developing it and with the end result - I should not be concerned with making money or garnering a large user base.
-   I will be using htmx for my next project, since the sentiment of these last couple episodes I have listened to is clearly to stay away from React if possible.
-   htmx docs (which I will need for later): [</> htmx - high power tools for html](https://htmx.org/).
-   htmx examples (also for later): [</> htmx ~ Examples](https://htmx.org/examples/).
