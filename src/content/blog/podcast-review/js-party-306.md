[New Year's Party ðŸŽŠ (JS Party #306) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/306)

- Good to hear that Astro is moving to be an ever better tool - I am happy that I am starting to use it.
- I also hope that Astro trumps all of those other libraries, since it is the one I have thrown my hat in for.
- All in all, a great episode, but JS Party always is.
