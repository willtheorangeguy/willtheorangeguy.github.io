[Taking on Goliath with Nadia Odunayo, Founder and CEO (Changelog Interviews #577)](https://changelog.com/podcast/577)

-   I looked up StoryGraph originally when I was looking for a place to keep my reading record, but I never signed up for an account since I didn't want to have another account for that. Looks like I will need to give it another shot.
-   Currently I am using [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/), which has the benefit of being decentralized.
-   Even though they were pushing for more conversation around engineering, I really enjoyed hearing about all the research and how she found product-market fit.
