[Zed's secret sauce with Nathan Sobo (Changelog & Friends #33)](https://changelog.com/friends/33)

-   I really want to try Zed, but it is still not out for Windows, and the only way for me to try it on Linux is with a VM, which does not do well for the GPU accelerated effects.
-   It does make me want to switch to Linux the next time I reset my computer, just really hoping [SteamOS](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos) is a *real* thing by then.
-   To sum it up, as soon as Zed comes out for Windows I would not be opposed to switching from VS Code.
