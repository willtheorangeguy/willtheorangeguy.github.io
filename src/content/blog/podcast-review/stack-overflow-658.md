[Maximum Glitch: How to break Tetris - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/01/09/maximum-glitch-how-to-break-tetris/)

- Outside of the WAN Show, one of the only podcasts that I heard that actually brought up the beating of Tetris.
- Still really cool with how the kid did it.
- Wish I grew up in that age and it meant more to my actual life.
