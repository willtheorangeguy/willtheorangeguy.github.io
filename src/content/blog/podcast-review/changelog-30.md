[Future of [energy, content, food] featuring the hallway track at THAT Conference (Changelog & Friends #30)](https://changelog.com/friends/30)

-   Wow this was a wild ride. Great to hear another hallway track with all sorts of interesting topics.
-   I liked the discussion of energy and how we need to decentralize our focus on that at the beginning.
-   Did notice a little bit of conflict at the start, but I guess that makes sense when we are talking about pushing the boundaries of an industry that has been long standing in the American (+ Canadian) economy.
- The topic fits in well with a book I have been reading as of late with Bill Gates' thoughts on climate change and where we need to go.

- For the last "section" - now I really want to start a hydroponic farm. I don't think my current apartment would allow it, but looks like something to get into once I move.
- Hooking up some Python and Raspberry Pi based tools would be super cool...
