[Dear new developer with Dan Moore, author of 'Letters to a New Developer' (Changelog Interviews #572) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/572)

- Will have to check out the blog and the articles there - [Letters To A New Developer â€“ What I wish I had known when starting my development career](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/).
- The topics that were brought up about staying a couple of months or even a year behind the times hit close to home.
- I agree with their perspective and agree that it makes sense to be a little slower in adopting new tech you work with, so you do not have to constantly bounce around all over the place, and are not spending all your out of work time learning new tech.
