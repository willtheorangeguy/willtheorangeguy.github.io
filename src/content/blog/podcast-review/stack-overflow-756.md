[Meet the guy responsible for building the Call of Duty game engine - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/11/15/meet-the-guy-responsible-for-building-the-call-of-duty-game-engine/)

-   Not always a big listener of the Stack Overflow Podcast, but this was a good episode on something cool outside of the specifically programming sphere.
-   Not a lot of people think about all the work that goes into just building the engine for these games, so it was cool to peek behind the curtain.
