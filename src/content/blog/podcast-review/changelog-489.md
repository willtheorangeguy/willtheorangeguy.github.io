[Run your home on a Raspberry Pi with Mike Riley, author of Portable Python Projects (Changelog Interviews #489) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/489)

-   This was a super cool episode and I am happy that they got into it about Raspberry Pies? Pi's? Pis?
-   I am in the process of looking to get one and set up PiHole, so once I get that done I will definitely be checking out the book and getting even more fun projects set up.
-   Saying there is no time like the present to get these things done is very true.
