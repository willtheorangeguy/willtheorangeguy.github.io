[Elasticsearch is open source, again with Shay Banon (Changelog Interviews #614)](https://changelog.com/podcast/614)

-   I will admit that I fell victim to the same belief that Amazon ElasticSearch (now OpenSearch) was the same product as Elastic ElasticSearch.
-   Good to know that the real reason was just to deal with the trademark dispute, and now everything can go back to normal.
-   While not a likely customer for ElasticSearch (for a long time, probably), it was such a hot button issue I thought it was important to learn the backstory.
-   While doing some research before writting this post, I was not aware of how large [Elastic](https://elastic.co/) is as as a company now.
