[React: then & now with Tom Occhino & Shruti Kapoor (JS Party #349)](https://changelog.com/jsparty/349)

-   Looks like I am pretty much listening to these in sequential order now!
-   As someone who doesn't know a lot about web frameworks and rarely works with them, this was a great listen to get to know more about React at the start and now in the present.
-   Funny to listen to this a day before I watched [this video from Fireship](https://youtu.be/cuHDQhDhvPE?si=UthL3_VGdWSxqsHX) on YouTube.
