[Let's archive the web with Nick Sweeting from ArchiveBox (Changelog Interviews #619)](https://changelog.com/podcast/619)

-   This was another one of my favorite episodes.
-   I will be creating a Archive Box instance on my homelab (when I finally have time to set one up). Saving YouTube videos from playlists sounds like a great idea, and looks like one I will be getting started on.
-   Made me think about the idea of a "web museum", but I guess we already have that with the Internet Archive/Wayback Machine. I don't know if they accept donations of people's content however, so that seems like a great rabbit hole to go down.
-   The [Tweaks for YouTube extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweaks-for-youtube/ogkoifddpkoabehfemkolflcjhklmkge?pli=1) sounds super cool! I do suffer from the same problem, however, where I experience most of my YouTube from my phone.
