[htmx: a new old way to build the web with Carson Gross & Alex Russell (JS Party #307) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/307)

- It really is true - there are a ton of great links in this episode.
- While I like `JSON` for storing data when writing desktop programs, I think any websites I create that need this feature will definitely be going the way of `htmx`.
