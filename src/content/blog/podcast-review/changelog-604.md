[Why we need Ladybird with Andreas Kling & Chris Wanstrath (Changelog Interviews #604)](https://changelog.com/podcast/604)

-   There is no such thing as bad competition, so it is good to see another organization/company? getting into the browser space.
-   I looked up their website and was interested in compiling it, but that will need to be a project for later in life.
-   I am also interested in their serenityOS, but I could not find any ready to use images, so it will also need to be a project for late in life...
-   VM image please?
