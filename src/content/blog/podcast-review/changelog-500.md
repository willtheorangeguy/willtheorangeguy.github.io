[The legacy of CSS-Tricks with Chris Coyier (Changelog Interviews #500)](https://changelog.com/podcast/500)

-   To be honest, I am kind of surprised that they did not do more of a big thing for episode 500.
-   It was cool the hear all about CSS-Tricks and what it was like before the take over from Digital Ocean, I like the perspective Chris had on it.
-   I did not know that he was also one of the founders of CodePen, so that was cool to hear and find out about.
-   Also interesting to hear about the Digital Ocean take over before it took a turn for the worse, since some other episodes I have listened to/things I have heard on JS Party seem to think that Chris sucks for selling out to Digital Ocean.
