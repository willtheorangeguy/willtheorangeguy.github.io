[AI is changing the cybersecurity threat landscape with Gregory Richardson &amp; Ismael Valenzuela from Blackberry (Practical AI #294)](https://changelog.com/practicalai/294)

-   Makes sense that while hackers are using AI to generate new exploits and hacking tools, we can use what we already know about hacks/exploits/tools to try to predict that.
-   Next thing we know AV companies will be running local models in our antivirus systems, slowing our computers down even more. Or it will truck all our data back to some data center somewhere, and then that will be breached, and we will really be no better off than we started.
-   Cool to see that Blackberry has transitioned from the President's phone to cybersecurity. I did not know they did this but am happy to hear that people there still have a job and they are pushing innovation.
