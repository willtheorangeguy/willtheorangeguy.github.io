[ANTHOLOGY â€“ Self-hosted, self-confident & self-employed (Changelog & Friends #69)](https://changelog.com/friends/69)

-   I always love a good talk on self-hosting.
-   NixOS and the Nix Package Manager is something I have heard of before, and maybe it will be the way to go when I switch to Linux next year.
-   [Foo Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp) and [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp) sound fun!
-   All around a great episode with some fun people.
