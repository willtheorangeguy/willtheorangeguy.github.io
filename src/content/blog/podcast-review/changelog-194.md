[Elixir and the Future of Phoenix with José Valim (Changelog Interviews #194)](https://changelog.com/podcast/194)

- Listened to this episode because I wanted to hear more about the Elixir language after remembering the Changelog Media site is written in it.
- Didn't end up learning a whole ton about Elixir, but it was nice to hear the back story leading up to its creation.
- I don't think I will be using Elixir but some more (somewhat useless) trivia facts are never bad.
- Also, the cast for this episode is awesome, will definitely be listening to more José Valim episodes when I have them time.
