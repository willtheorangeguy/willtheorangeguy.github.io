[Celebrating Eleventy 2.0 ðŸŽ‰ with Zach Leatherman (JS Party #266) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/266)

- https://github.com/11ty/webc 
- WebC components are cool, looks like they haven't been updated in a while.
- Eleventy as a whole looks like it hasn't been updated in a while, I will need to do some more digging on that. _Editor's Note: I am not sure why I said this when I originally wrote the review, they are very up to date, and [recently became a part of Font Awesome!](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/).
- Saw the `screenshoot` library on their docs, which looks like a very cool way to show screenshots on an 11ty site.
