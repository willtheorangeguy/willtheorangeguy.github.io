[Build faster websites with Astro 1.0 featuring Fred K. Schott (JS Party #238) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/238)

- My second favorite episode of JS Party, what pushed me to create an Astro site, however actually creating it is quite delayed. _Would like to add an editor's note that it is no longer delayed: you are currently on that Astro site!_
