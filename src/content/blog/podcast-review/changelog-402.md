[What's next for José Valim and Elixir? (Changelog Interviews #402)](https://changelog.com/podcast/402)

- After just listening to the ["Elixir and the Future of Phoenix" episode]([Elixir and the Future of Phoenix with José Valim (Changelog Interviews #194)](https://changelog.com/podcast/194)), I was interested in hearing more about the Elixir journey.
- Once again, the cast of this episode is great!
- Was cool to hear José Valim moving along in the development career. I could not find too much information on Plataformatec, but Nubank has quite the well designed website.
- Still not super interested in starting an Elixir project but from what I could see on the new Dashbit website it looks super cool!
