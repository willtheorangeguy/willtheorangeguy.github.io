[Who's that girl? It's Jess! (JS Party #313) (changelog.com)](https://changelog.com/jsparty/313)

- Great to hear that there is another panelist on the show, I have not been listening to a lot of JS Party as of late so I had totally forgotten about the new addition.
- The 20 (15) questions was super fun.
- But, I was really interested in the topic "Apple kills EU web apps" since this was something I had heard about on other podcasts as well.
  - While a little late to the game when listening to this podcast, it was interesting to get the developer perspective and not just the techie perspective.
  - I agree with the statement that really only developers care about this, the end user is very unlikely to care where 30% of their payment goes - and of course our good buddy Apple is banking on that.
- Totally worth giving this one a listen if you want to know more, regardless of the fact that the time for this has kind of passed.
