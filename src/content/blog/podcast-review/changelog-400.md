[Big updates in Safari 14 with Ronak Shah and Beth Dakin (Changelog Interviews #400) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/400)

- While it was cool to hear from the actual people behind Safari development at Apple, it was clearly just a marketing exercise.
- Not one of my favorite episodes to listen to.
- I did enjoy hearing about their three pillars, which makes sense based off what Apple is trying to do and how that would keep people using Safari and using a Mac.
- I have never actually experienced using Face ID to log in to a website, and I do have an iPhone, so it must have been a feature that did not see overall great adoption.
