[The making of GitHub Sponsors with Devon Zuegel (Changelog Interviews #370)](https://changelog.com/podcast/370)

-   Wow, I feel old now. I was listening thinking that this episode would have been released in 2021 or 2022, but then checked the date and realized GitHub Sponsors has been around since 2019!
-   Another nice look behind the curtain at GitHub, cool to see what is going on at a large engineering org.
-   I think bug bounties could definitely be introduced, if we are trying to give people more options rather than less options, why not give them that option as well. The division of money between maintainer and issue "closer" can be solved by having that configurable in the `.yaml` file, and having that info public when completing a bounty. Or, at least that's how I would implement it.
