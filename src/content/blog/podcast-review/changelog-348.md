[Python's new governance and core team featuring Brett Cannon (Changelog Interviews #348) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/348)

-   Change from a dictator to a steering committee, which I honestly think was the correct decision.
-   Of course, I came into Python after all of this had happened so I wouldn't know the difference.
