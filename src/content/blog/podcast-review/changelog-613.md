[Lessons from 10k hours of programming (Remastered) with Matt Rickard (Changelog Interviews #613)](https://changelog.com/podcast/613)

-   As a starting dev some of this was useful, some of this was above my head - but that is true to the description of the episode.
-   Nice to see remasters of old episodes on slow news weeks, since this gives me a chance to listen to popular episodes before I even knew the Changelog existed.
