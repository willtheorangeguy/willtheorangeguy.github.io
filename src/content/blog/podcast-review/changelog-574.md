[Let's talk FreeBSD (finally) with Allan Jude (Changelog Interviews #574) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/574)

- This was such a nerdy show but was super fun to listen to.
- As soon as I got back from listening to it I spun up FreeBSD on a VM.
- Looking forward to trying it out - will probably write more about it.
