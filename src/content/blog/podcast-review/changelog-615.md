[Rails is having a moment (again) with David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), creator of Ruby on Rails (Changelog Interviews #615)](https://changelog.com/podcast/615)

-   Listened to this as a recommendation from a previous podcast.
-   Did not know a lot about Rails, except for all the common sites built on it.
-   I am tempted to try something with it, but I might stick to a Python framework instead...
