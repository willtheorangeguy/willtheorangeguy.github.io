# Is htmx the way to Go? featuring Carson Gross - Go Time

[Is htmx the way to Go? featuring Carson Gross (Go Time #266) |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/gotime/266)

-   This episode was a little over my head considering I do not usually listen to Go Time, but I enjoyed it and like learning more about Go
-   Everyone's sentiment on React and JSON and REST is all the same...
-   In my Pasta Tracker project, I will be using htmx to hopefully make the process easier - however, I hope that does not set me up for failure later on in life when looking for a career
-   htmx docs (which I will need for later): [</> htmx - high power tools for html](https://htmx.org/)
-   htmx examples (also for later): [</> htmx ~ Examples](https://htmx.org/examples/)
