# Is inequality inevitable? - Bill Gates and Rashida Jones Ask Big Questions

[EP 2: Is inequality inevitable - Bill Gates and Rashida Jones Ask Big Questions](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-2-is-inequality-inevitable/id1538630420?i=1000499889070)

-   The title is a tongue twister and kind of hard to type.
-   I think that inequality is a large problem, one that was brought to the forefront by COVID-19.
-   The study they did in Seattle about helping people find good housing made sense and I am interested in looking more into that study.
-   To be honest, I think a lot more time and effort should be being put into the inequality of housing, and reducing the old money that keeps the disadvantaged out of the housing market.
