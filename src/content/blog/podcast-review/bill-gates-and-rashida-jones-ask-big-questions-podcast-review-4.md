[EP 4: Is it too late to stop climate change? - Bill Gates and Rashida Jones Ask Big Questions](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-4-is-it-too-late-to-stop-climate-change/id1538630420?i=1000501570134)

- This episode came at a good time for me as well since I was in a **very cold** area of Canada, and I could already tell that people were going to be using that as a tool to deny climate change.
- Near the end learning about the specific things that we can do to combat climate change was helpful as well.
- I had no idea that eating organic food was actually worse for the environment because of the extra land that it uses, I need to do additional research on that to make changes to my shopping habits.
