[>ANTHOLOGY — Packages, pledges & protocols (Changelog Interviews #616)](https://changelog.com/podcast/616)

-   This entire episode felt like an ad.

1. Cool to hear about CentOS, but to be honest, it does not really apply to me, and therefore I did not find it overly useful.
2. Another blockchain technology? Just sounds like another ad for VC BS.
3. While I like that an organization is trying to take on the funding of open source, it just seemend like another ad.
