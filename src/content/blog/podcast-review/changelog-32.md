[Brewing up something for work with Mike McQuaid from Homebrew/Workbrew (Changelog & Friends #32)](https://changelog.com/friends/32)

-   As a Windows user, I don't use Homebrew a lot, but it was cool to hear more behind the scenes talk.
-   Always love these Changelog & Friends episodes where they go down as many rabbit holes as possible.
-   ...and the conversation on the Apple Vision Pro is always funny, one must wonder when they will finally find a market to fit that product into.
