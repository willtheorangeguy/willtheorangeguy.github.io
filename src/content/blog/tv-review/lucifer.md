-   The show has great storytelling and great writing during the first few seasons, but getting into the last seasons, the show takes a turn for the worse focusing more on the romantic relationships of the characters as opposed to the themes of crime, comedy, and mystery that viewers were promised in the beginning.
-   Tom Ellis is a a great actor and I really enjoyed seeing him throughout the show, but if I were to watch it again, I see no point in going past the first couple of seasons. Once you feel it start to drop off, watch a couple more episodes and then move on to something else on your list.
