- Continuing on from the previous book in the series, this is a great book (and a great series) that I should have read when I was in grade five, its target audience.
- I found this book to be shorter, but not as easy to get into. The first 30% of the book was difficult for me, but I was able to blaze through the end!
- Overall an easy and enjoyable read.
