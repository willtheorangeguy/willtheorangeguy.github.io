When Twitter (now X) gotten taken over, I hopped on the Fediverse rush with everyone else. After creating a Mastodon account, which unfortunately I rarely use anymore (I also rarely use Twitter anymore either), I stumbled upon [bookwyrm.social](https://bookwyrm.social/). It is an [open source](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm) website built for "social reading and reviewing, decentralized with ActivityPub".

Learning how to use the site really got me back into reading, and I love the fact that I can now share my future reading lists, what I am reading now, and what I have already completed. My completed list is pretty short as of right now, but with the summer off, I am trying to expand it every day. I am aware that all of these features can just as easily be had with GoodReads, but why support an Amazon marketing machine, when we could use open source, decentralized software.

If you are also looking for a place to socially share your current, past, and future reads, I hope you will join [me](https://bookwyrm.social/user/willtheorangeguy) on [bookwyrm.social](https://bookwyrm.social/)!
