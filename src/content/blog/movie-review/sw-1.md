The film excels in its world-building, offering breathtaking visuals, elaborate set designs, and a thrilling podrace sequence. However, its characterization, especially the controversial portrayal of Jar Jar Binks and the wooden performances from some actors, leaves much to be desired. While the film's story is rich in lore, its pacing can be slow, and the dialogue at times feels stilted. Despite its flaws, The Phantom Menace remains an important chapter in the Star Wars saga, with an unforgettable lightsaber duel and a memorable score by John Williams, a personal favorite composer.
