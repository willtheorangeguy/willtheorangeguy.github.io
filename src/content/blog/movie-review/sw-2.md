Movie dives deeper into Anakin Skywalker's journey and his eventual fall to the Dark Side. The film has some standout action sequences, like the arena battle and the epic clone wars, but the dialogue can feel a bit cringey, especially the love scenes between Anakin and Padme. The CGI is impressive for its time, though it sometimes overpowers the story. Overall, it’s not as iconic as some of the other Star Wars films, but it's still a solid watch for fans of the franchise.
