Welcome to the new @willtheorangeguy blog and portfolio website. Hoping that this can be the place to share dev tips, random personal thoughts, tech stuff, and travel musings.

If you want to learn more about me or my work check out the [Resume](/resume) and [Projects](/projects) pages - there are tons of cool things to see over there.
Also check out the [Labs](/labs) page, where you can see my random side projects, and what is pretty much my online code sandbox. I'm most proud of the [Bucket List](/bucket-list), or the [/purpose](/purpose) page to go a little more in depth on why this site actually exists.

Finally, check out the [Uses](/uses) page to learn more about my daily development setup looks like. It features links to my development environment, web browser, crucial desktop apps, games, and my computer and builds.

This website itself is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the theme you are currently enjoying is a slightly customized version of [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/).

Last side note, to connect with me on all sorts of social media, check out the [social media](/posts/social-media) post on the blog where I have tried to compile a list of almost all my social media network handles.
