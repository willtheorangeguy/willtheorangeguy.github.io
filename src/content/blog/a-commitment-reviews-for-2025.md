description: Starting in 2025, there are a lot more reviews I want to publish here, and on various channels
---

I'm not the kind of person who does New Year's Resolutions (it is actually better to do them at the start of a [new school year](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sustainable-life-satisfaction/202408/goal-setting-and-resolutions-for-the-new-school-year)), but for this year I want to try and post more reviews to the blog and "social media" channels. Coming up with things to post can be hard, but reviewing what I am interacting with in my daily life is pretty easy. So, starting tomorrow (January 2nd), I will be synchronizing my reviews from online sites and platforms to this blog.

I will also be ensuring that additional reviews are being created, on the regular, for not just podcasts, but games, TV shows, movies, and books. However, there might not be a lot of the last one since it takes me a while to read a book nowadays. I have chosen a number of sites for these reviews, and I'll link them down below, but all will also be synced to this blog, as a kind of "eternal library archive". Don't forget to check them out or leave a comment if I should expand into more review areas!
