description: Today I learned that GitHub Mobile uses very little data.
---

I am currently making my way through the amazingly beautiful countryside of Vietnam, and as part of that journey, I find myself spending a lot of time on long distance bus transportation. Since cellular data is super cheap in Southeast Asia, I have been able to use my phone and laptop quite a bit while on the go, and have been accomplishing some small tasks when I otherwise should be sleeping...

One of these tasks was moving a lot of my notes for blog post ideas from the Notes app on my iPhone to GitHub Issues. Another task was going through all of the GitHub notifications I had let pile up while on vacation. So, while riding the bus, I decided to take on these tasks and was pleasantly surprised when I found the GitHub Mobile app using barely any data.

After going through and creating a ton of issues, dealing with all of my notifications (including submitting reviews and merging pull requests), and getting distracted and browsing the explore page, GitHub Mobile only used 10.8 MB of data. In today's landscape of apps that scrape data and upload it all the time is amazing. This really is not that exciting, since I would hope most developers are optimizing their apps like this, but I found it too cool not to write a post about it.
