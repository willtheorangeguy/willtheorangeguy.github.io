-   This is one of the best Need for Speed games, one that I return to over and over again.
-   I love racing games for their real life fun and the great visuals, but this game combines those to a whole new level. Even when the visuals aren't amazing the trade off between racer and cop careers makes up for it.
-   Also another fun game to play on the Steam Deck, which makes pausing the racer career easy.
