-   A great FREE game in the Fallout Universe.
-   Good for killing time, and it is super easy to pick up and put down again, so it lends itself well to playing on the Steam Deck.
-   Game is making its way towards being retired, there are better games to play if you have the time and want to invest it, but the story line is great and it is a fun game all around.
