-   The ever-changing seasons impact driving conditions, adding variety and strategy to each race and exploration.
-   A huge roster of cars, from classic muscle cars to exotic super cars, giving players plenty of choices to suit their style, however, they are mainly unlocked with expensive DLC, on top of an already expensive game, so make sure to get it on sale.
-   Smooth and intuitive controls that balance realism with accessibility.
-   Overall, a great racing game and another awesome instalment in the series.
-   Also, another great game to play on the Steam Deck.
