-   Currently playing on the Steam Deck, this is one of the best games for that format. Super easy to pick up and put down at any spot in the story line.
-   Nothing difficult in the game, it is really relaxing, and overall a fun game to play for all audiences. I think that it would appeal to anyone who likes role playing or simulator or adventure games, or honestly anything in between.
-   And it's usually on sale for a decent price too!
-   Can't go wrong with this one.
