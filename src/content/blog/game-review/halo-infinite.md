-   Bumped up the score a bit because of the great previous games in the Halo series, but this game needed more time before release. It got better, but still wasn't good enough, so was retired. I would recommend getting the Master Chief Collection and just playing all of those instead.

-   _Note:_ The exorbitant price of the campaign was also a no go for me, since I prefer single player games.
