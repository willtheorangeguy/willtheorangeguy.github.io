- Currently playing on the Steam Deck, this is one of the best games for that format. Super easy to pick up and put down at any spot in the story line.
- Nothing difficult in the game, it is really relaxing, and overall a fun game to play for all audiences.
- And it's usually on sale for a decent price too! Can't go wrong with this one.
- To add extra spice, play with the tModLoader (and with friends) - it makes the game so much better.
