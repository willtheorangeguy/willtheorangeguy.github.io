    Access the photos and videos I took during my trip to Europe, where I tried to sample at least one of each country's flag.

On my recent-ish trip to Europe, I decided to start on a project where I attempted to take a photo and video of each country's flag. I have compiled all of them on a simple portfolio page.

Check it out here: [williamvdg.me/blogs/personal/photography/flags/](https://williamvdg.me/blogs/personal/photography/flags/)

All of the photos are hosted on GitHub, and the videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@willtheorangeguy).
