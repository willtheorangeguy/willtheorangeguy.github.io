- Had a great stay, they were so friendly and kind, even lending us one of their own helmets to use on the motorbike
- Beds were soft and the room was nice
- Very affordable
- Dinner was delicious
- We had a nice private area in the large dorm room
- It is a bit out of town, so you will likely need to take a taxi or motorbike, but it is worth it
- Wish we had known the cost of the dinner beforehand
