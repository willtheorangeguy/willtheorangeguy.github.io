-   Great location, you are within a 15 minute walk to all activities.
-   The pool and gym have a beautiful view.
-   The room was smaller than based on the photos, and we didn’t have a fridge, but they brought us one soon after.
-   Bathroom was clean, unfortunately no fan, but we opened the window wide.
-   Bed was large and comfortable.
-   A little expensive for what you get, but the view and the location are great!
