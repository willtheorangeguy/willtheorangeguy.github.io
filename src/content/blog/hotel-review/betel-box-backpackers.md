-   Great location, easily accessible by public transport and close to the water.
-   A more affordable option in Singapore.
-   Lovely common area. _It truly was a great place to work._
-   Wifi required an OTP to connect, which was reset every day.
-   The breakfast was just bread and jam/peanut butter which was underwhelming for the price. _Honestly, this was easily solved by eating a lot of the bread and adding peanut butter._
-   There was no curtains or socket near the bed which was annoying. _This was by far the most annoying and heartbreaking part of the hostel._
