description: After returning from my trip, I buckled down and finished publishing my backlog of reviews
---

A while back I wrote about how I was moving all my reviews to this blog and to several online review platforms that fit the type of content I was trying to review. It has been a while since then (the start of 2025), but now all the reviews are complete. I went through my back catalog of all the movies and TV shows I had watched, games I had played, and books I read, creating a review for each of them.

_I did have a little bit of help, using locally running AI models through Ollama when my reviews were coming up short – looking at you IMDb._

I also made a breaking change to the way the reviews are distributed on my blog! In an attempt to create a kind of digital garden for my public “notes on reading, watching, coding, and more”, I started organizing all my reviews, public task lists, kanban boards, and notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and have them published to [williamvdg.me/notes](williamvdg.me/notes) using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). While I am still getting the hang of using a lot of the features, it really has been a more useful way to organize and share my reviews.

Going forward, I will continue to update my reviews every time I watch, listen to, read, or learn something, but it will be at a slower pace… The note taking style of Obsidian + Quartz is more appealing however, and hopefully that encourages me to take down more notes.
