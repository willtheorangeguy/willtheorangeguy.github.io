description: A list of things that I really don't like about the Apple Watch.
---

This is an open letter to the Apple Watch engineers, developers, and designers with things I really wish would change - or if there is a good reason for things to be this way, I would love to know why!

```
Note: this is based on experience with an Apple Watch Series 6
```

1. No way to lower brightness very low.
2. Seems to have way less touch points as you get near the edge of the screen.
3. Lots of apps require you to have the app open on your phone in order for them to work, which kind of defeats the purpose of a smart watch doesnâ€™t it?
4. The Watch app on iOS should have all the settings for the Apple Watch on it, not just some cherry picked ones.
5. There is no Notes app. There should be a way to turn a voice recording into a note using speech to text.
6. The way it decides which colour of the flashlight to use is really inconsistent. It should either decide based on the time of day, or just leave it to what you last used.
