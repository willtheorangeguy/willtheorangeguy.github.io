description: A list of things that I really don't like about Windows 10.

This is an open letter to the Windows 10 (and Office) developers with things I really wish would change - or if there is a good reason for things to be this way, I would love to know why!

1. The Photos app sucks.
2. Why does everything need to come from the Microsoft Store? MSI installers were lovely.
3. Scrolling on the OneDrive desktop app is very touchy. _This seems to be a hit or miss issue._
4. Excel’s handling of the time number format sucks, it can never convert colloquial uses of time to actual data unless you renter for exactly how it wants.
5. There are now ads in every corner of an OS I paid for.
6. Let’s slap AI all over the search bar.
7. Why do you not prioritize the local files on my machine over the internet in search?
8. Sleep sucks on a laptop in Windows 10, and even more on desktop - so much so that I just run [PowerToys Awake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/awake) 24/7 on the desktop and only turn on/off my monitor.
