description: Access the photos of the construction sites and signs I took in Europe.
---

On my recent-ish trip to Europe, I also tried to take a photo of at least one construction sign or construction site in each country. As a child, I had a thing for construction signs, so I thought this would be perfect for my first trip to the other side of the world alone. The project is called _Men at Work_ since I thought that was a funny reference to the song, but also how many signs just feature men - ironic for a progressive continent like Europe.

All of the photos are hosted on GitHub.
